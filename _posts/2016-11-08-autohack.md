# How I almost hacked my own network

> A challenger appears

Like many people I have more than one wireless network at home. What do you mean you don't? My first is for a direct connection to the UK network provider I rent my line from. Another is the one that the majority of my hardware connects to, an always on VPN with better encryption and firewall rules. Not that I'm paranoid but if I'm doing stuff on the internet, even my daily goings on, as banal as they are, are mine to keep secret if I so desire. Both are networked and bridged anyway so if one were to gain access via the UK access point they'd have access to the greater network infrasctructure behind the VPN'd router anyway. Because I think I'm funny and I needed to be able to identify them quickly I opted to name them after government intelligence gathering organisations.

Recently I've been exploring the local neighbourhood radio for a project which is undoubtedly illegal but hopefully beneficial to the hood as a whole. Look out for an article called "Robbin' The Hood" in the next few months for more on that.

During these exploratory expeditions I noticed a strange outlier. An SSID named "NSA". Whoa. Someone's got the joke and then joined in. Naturally I took that as a challenge to investigate further.

I fired up my ~~cyberdeck~~ ~~hacktop~~ chromebook and took a closer look. All the traffic around me was on channels, 1, 6, and 11 as per normal for 802.11 a–g 2.4GhZ networks. All apart from NSA which was at 149. That's quite a radio you've got there my friend. Next was to poke the SSID for the BSSID MAC address. Because all MAC address ranges belong to specific vendors this gives you the manufacturer of the router and sometimes the model. Interesting, that's the router manufacturer I'm using on my VPN network. Perhaps our friend isn't just a consumer. Colour me intrigued.

In fact, that hardware address is a single character removed from mine… That seems suspicious.

I log in to my router and look at the wlan settings. NSA. Right there in the 5GhZ radio settings. I challenged myself to hack my network by forgetting I'd called my upper range beacon NSA the year previously.

So what did I learn from this? That it's possible to surprise yourself, that past me is a smart arse, it's possible to have an exciting evening and learn new things _without_ breaking into my neighbours wifi.
